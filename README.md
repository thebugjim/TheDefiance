#Spies

Spies is a Google Hangouts application based on the party game [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), created at and for SB Hacks.


A Google Hangout is Google's version of a Skype call. It allows participants to video chat and use apps together.


Mafia is one of our favorite party games, and we realized a Google Hangouts application would be a great way to be able to play it face-to-face with our friends far away.


The basic idea is:
 - two teams: spies vs civilians
 - spies try to sneakily kill all the civilians
 - civilians try to find out who the spies are
 - first to achieve their goal wins
 - BONUS: one civilian is a doctor and can prevent spies from killing a civilian if they correctly guess who the victim would have been

 

We're most proud of the fact that we could get a working app finished in 36 hours (probably could've been 24 if we knew what closures were beforehand). We learned some cool javascript concepts along the way.
